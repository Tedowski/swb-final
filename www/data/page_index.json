Our goal is to build the first public skatepark in Maputo, Mozambique by fall 2019 in order to support Maputo\u2019s skateboarding community. To reach our goal we\u2019ve teamed up with <a href='https:\/\/www.seznam.cz' target='_blank'>Skate-aid<\/a> and ASM<br><br> Mozambique is a country located in southeast Africa experiencing a \u2018youth bulge\u2019 in its population. We believe skateboarding can be used as a tool to keep kids away from the dangers of drug use and crime, which are unfortunately prevalent in Mozambique\u2019s capital city.<br><br> This project will also provide the city of Maputo with a hip and resurgent place of recreation and assembly."
