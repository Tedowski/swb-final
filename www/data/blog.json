Ambassadors is a long established board company operating in Czech Republic, so they very much understood what is skateboarding capable of. We had this really nice chat and I forgot for a minute that we actually met to make a deal, because it simply seemed as if we just chatted as old friends. Maybe an hour has passed and we went through the reasons of this project, the design of the board, the sizes, shapes and quantity. Jan, who is the manager, asked me to send him a document explaining what is at stake for AMB? I did that, they liked and we shook hands later on. They became official sponsors of our project and will sponsor us with some boards and clothes that we will be able to bring to Mozambique for the kids.<br><br>Thank you Ambassadors, we are looking forward to painting your logo in the skatepark.<br><br>Martin<br><br> Skate World Better"
