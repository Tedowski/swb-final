People would come and go, but we were so dragged into the planning, that we would barely care about the daily rush. We talked and talked, we drafted a contract between us, skate-aid and ASM who is our partner on the grounds in Mozambique. It is signed by now, so we are happy to announce that we have obtained a land 20x40m in the suburban area of Maputo called Costa do Sol for realization of this project. Yay! <br><br> Now we communicate on daily bases in this triangle of ours to obtain all the necessary documentation prior to arriving to Maputo, so that we avoid any delays. We are also having the land buldozed and prepared for shaping. It is still a long run before it is going to be ready for the very work, but the communication goes pretty smooth so far, so we stay positive that we will skate world better soon. <br><br>After few nice days in Hamburg, when we managed to successfully work out a contract and skate a notorious spot called ROTE FLORA I prolonged a this trip to Berlin to meet the ambassador of Mozambique in Berlin. More about that later.<br><br>Martin<br><br> Skate World Better                                "

You can guess what my answer was.<br><br>Few days later I met Tadea\u0301s\u030c, Vi\u0301tek and Adam, two Czech guys and one Slovakian studying in Copenhagen, for the first time in their school and from that moment on would be meeting on regular basis. It was a whole lot of work, but also a great fun just meeting at my place, drinking beer and trying out our options. They stand behind these pages and I really think they did a pretty good job. Thanks so much guys and see you in Mozambique!<br><br>Thank you Ambassadors, we are looking forward to painting your logo in the skatepark.<br><br>Martin<br><br> Skate World Better                                "
